var letter = `JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, 
prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language. ${name} Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of 
the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production. It is used to make webpages interactive and provide
 online programs, including video games. The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it 
 without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in ${name} engine. Each of the many JavaScript engines represent
  a different implementation of ${name}, all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not supporting
   the spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA. ${1+1}`;
